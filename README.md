### Hi there 👋

I'm Ben, a software developer with a love for elegant solutions to enrich user experiences. With a STEM background and entrepreneurial experience, I bring a new perspective in my approach to software development,

🌱 **About Me**

- 💻 I'm a Washington-based software developer. 
- 🎓 Graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.
- 🌟 The main languages and technologies I've used in my past projects include: JavaScript, Python, React, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Django. 
- 📚 I'm an avid learner and constantly working to expand my toolbox to include today's in-demand technologies.

🚀 **What I'm Working On**

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on "Gively", a social donation app for charitable giving and resource sharing and "brewista", a comprehensive digital companion for coffee brewing. I've also been compiling some of
  my most reused react components using a variety of technologies and libraries I've used in the past, also rewriting them in Typescript to become more familiar.
